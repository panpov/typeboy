# TypeBoy

## March 5, 2025: Hello!
Welcome to the TypeBoy repo. Jun and I (Pan) will be making a simple text editor ROM for the Game Boy, because I like making quirky programs but Jun doesn't but he likes making programs so he's joining me. We are calling the text editor TypeBoy until we find a better name. Maybe we won't. What we did today:
- Spent 2~ hours
- Brainstormed ideas for how typing would work.
- We came up with 3 types of typing. Our thoughts are recorded [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGg6SYRRPU/4CMcSRlry2y0dif6VhZBfg/view?utm_content=DAGg6SYRRPU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h42bbeacbb4).
- Next steps: start coding, maybe think about what we want the tileset to look like.

## March 20, 2025: The Coding Begins
What we did today:
- Spend 45~ mins
- We created a base that we could use to actually develop TypeBoy.
- We will develop the three diferrent types of typing and then figure out which one we want to focus on. We could also just develop three different versions. For now, Jun will develop Type 1, and I will develop Type 2.
- Next steps: develop the different types of typing, which includes tilesets/tilemaps and the actual code.
