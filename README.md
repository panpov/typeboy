# TypeBoy

## March 5, 2025: Hello!
Welcome to the TypeBoy repo. Jun and I (Pan) will be making a simple text editor ROM for the Game Boy, because I like making quirky programs but Jun doesn't but he likes making programs so he's joining me. We are calling the text editor TypeBoy until we find a better name. Maybe we won't. What we did today:
- Spent 2~ hours
- Brainstormed ideas for how typing would work.
- We came up with 3 types of typing. Our thoughts are recorded [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGg6SYRRPU/4CMcSRlry2y0dif6VhZBfg/view?utm_content=DAGg6SYRRPU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h42bbeacbb4).
- Next steps: start coding, maybe think about what we want the tileset to look like.
